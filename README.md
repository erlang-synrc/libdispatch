libdispatch
===========

This is my port of libdispatch on Linux.

Theres is two branches for that:
* linux-1.0 which is the version used in Snow Leopard
* linux-1.1 which is the version used in Lion.
  For this version, you will need the dev release of libkqueue and libpthread_workqueue that
  you will find at <svn://mark.heily.com/libkqueue/trunk> and <svn://mark.heily.com/libkqueue/trunk>
